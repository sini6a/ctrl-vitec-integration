## Description

The CTRL Vitec WP Integration plugin seamlessly integrates the Swedish real estate system Vitec into your WordPress website. This plugin, written in pure PHP, leverages on-the-fly loading of data directly from the Vitec system. To optimize performance, the plugin initially loads essential data, such as images, in low quality and dynamically replaces them with high-quality versions using JavaScript in the background.


## Installation


**Note: This plugin is currently under active development. While it is a functional version, there are ongoing improvements and additional features to be implemented.**

To test the plugin, follow these steps:

1.  Download the zipped file from this repository.
2.  Upload the file directly to your WordPress website, similar to any other plugin installation.

After installation, configure your credentials in the WordPress settings to establish a connection with your Vitec username/password. You can then implement the integration on any web page using the `[ctrl-vitec-integration]` shortcode.


## Changelog

-   **0.1:** Initial implementation of the plugin.
